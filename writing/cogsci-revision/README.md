Reviewer feedback:
=================

Reviewer 1
----------

* Isn’t it surprising that this expectation is so strong
that, in the original design, it leads listeners to pay more attention
to their false presumption of their interlocutor’s cooperativeness
than they do to salient features of the physical environment (i.e.,
what their interlocutor can and can’t see)? This is interesting, and I
think worth emphasizing and exploring the implications of.

      * Agreed. I think this is where our results are consistent with a probabilistic weighting model (e.g. Heller et al, 2016). Expectations about cooperativeness are one source of pressure toward downweighting features of the environment, but such a model predicts that variations on the task can push this around, e.g. by making the environment more or less salient, making one's partner more or less trustworthy, and so on. **I'll add a line citing the heller paper (now that it's out), and how our results fit into that broader view.**

* Minor comment: Figure 3 - I’m not sure what we are supposed to take
from this graph. A bar chart might not be the best medium. If we’re
looking at the correlation a scatterplot might be better. Also Figure 4
comes out of sequence - it would be clearer to switch the order of these
two figures.

    * Awesome suggestion -- the scatter plot is much better. Making this plot also suggested we run the corersponding regression, which we reported in the text.

Reviewer 2
----------

* one important theoretical question remains which is unaddressed in the
present paper: What is the proper role of egocentrism or the lack of
de-centration in adult’s theory of mind reasoning?
    * Again, I think we can appeal to the heller paper on this point; it's compelling to me that adults are weighting multiple sources of information, some private, others social, and a wider variety of tasks are needed to tease out exactly what these sources are, and what determines the weighting.

Reviewer 3
----------

* I cannot help but think they partially missed the point of the
original work on which they are building and that they are less
refuting the work of Keysar and colleagues than exploring different
avenues [...]  The point of Keysar et al. was precisely to setup a
situation where the director's utterance was ambiguous from the
matcher's point of view so that they would be forced to decide on the
basis of what information is, and isn't, in their common ground. If
directors circumvent this key manipulation by overspecifying referents
("block with the blue writing"), which yes, might be a natural response
to ambiguity, you're no longer putting the matcher in a position in
which they have to consider common ground at all. They just pick what
is perceptually most salient. That's not what was being studied.

    * I think this is true, to a certain extent. We're not refuting that people often ignore common ground, just giving evidence for a reason **why** they might be doing so. And it turns out that this reason involves theory of mind, and is an unintended consequence of the way the key manipulation is set up.

* There is substiantial subsequent work that does explore the nature of the
interference presented by distractors, interference that isn't merely
explained by director underspecification. Such as the cross-cultural work
by Wu and Keysar (2009) and its followup eye-tracking analysis in Wu,
Barr, Gann and Keysar (2013). There's also similar interesting work by
Luk, Xiao, and Cheung (2012) that might be worth exploring.

    * These are great references, and I wish we had the space in the manuscript for a broader discussion.

*   In regards to the experimental paradigm: moving to a web-based setup and
communication through a text box sets up additional differences from the
original study worth considering. First, that some degree of training is
necessary to have participants not only understand that objects in the
black boxes are not co-present (which is intuitively understood when
using a physically co-present grid) -- and that this added difficulty
(adapting to a non-naturalistic marker of what is, and isn't co-present)
also puts speakers in a situation in which they might choose to adopt a
strategy that circumvents the need to consider what is co-present, and
just over-specify instead.

     * This is a good point, and I added a sentence about this in the general discussion.

* In regards to director over-specification and its relation to the Gricean
Maxim of Quality, the authors might also like to refer to a similar
discussion in Gann and Barr (2014) that uses a similar setup and
specifically manipulates factors such as the availability and quality of
feedback in directors' need to pre-emptively overspecify referents to
avoid potential confusion. These data from this paper would probably fit
into such a conversation very neatly.

      * Added the Gann and Barr (2014) citation in the section where we discuss overspecification; wish we had more space to discuss this, too.
