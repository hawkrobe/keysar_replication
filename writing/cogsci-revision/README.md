Reviewer feedback:
=================

* Isn’t it surprising that this expectation is so strong
that, in the original design, it leads listeners to pay more attention
to their false presumption of their interlocutor’s cooperativeness
than they do to salient features of the physical environment (i.e.,
what their interlocutor can and can’t see)? This is interesting, and I
think worth emphasizing and exploring the implications of.

      * Agreed. I think this is where our results are consistent with a probabilistic weighting model (e.g. Heller et al, 2016). Expectations about cooperativeness are one source of pressure toward downweighting features of the environment, but such a model predicts that variations on the task can push this around, e.g. by making the environment more or less salient, making one's partner more or less trustworthy, and so on. **I'll add a line citing the heller paper (now that it's out), and how our results fit into that broader view.**

* Minor comment: Figure 3 - I’m not sure what we are supposed to take
from this graph. A bar chart might not be the best medium. If we’re
looking at the correlation a scatterplot might be better. Also Figure 4
comes out of sequence - it would be clearer to switch the order of these
two figures.

    -- *I'll see whether a scatter plot looks better...*

* one important theoretical question remains which is unaddressed in the
present paper: What is the proper role of egocentrism or the lack of
de-centration in adult’s theory of mind reasoning?
