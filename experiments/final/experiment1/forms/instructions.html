	<p>
	  In this experiment you will play a fun communication game
	  with another turker! One of you will be assigned
	  the <b>Director</b> role and the other will be
	  the <b>Matcher</b>. Since you will not know which role you
	  will play until the game starts, you will be responsible for
	  understanding the responsibilities and goals of both roles.
	</p>

	<p>
	  On each round of the game, we will randomly pick a few
	  everyday objects and place them in a grid. Although you will
	  just see a 2D view in the game, you can imagine you are
	  sitting across the table from your partner with cubbyholes
	  between you.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/3d_objs.jpg"
		 alt="Example array"
		 style="width:300px;height:300px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  The Director will be shown a series of instructions about
	  how the objects in the grid need to be moved. However, only
	  the Matcher has the ability to move objects. To succeed at
	  the game, the Director must send messages through the chat
	  box telling the Matcher how to move the objects. It is
	  important to give instructions as clearly as possible. Given
	  the below screen, for example, the Director would want the
	  Matcher to move the umbrella to the right.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/director_example.png"
		 alt="director view"
		 style="width:300px;height:320px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  The goal of the Matcher on each instruction is to identify
	  which object must be moved, and where to move it, based on
	  the message sent by the Director. You will follow these
	  instructions by clicking and dragging items from one cell of
	  the grid to another. If you are the Matcher, you will first
	  need to wait until the Director has sent their message
	  before being able to move an object or replying through the
	  chatbox.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Once the Matcher moves the object they believe the Director
	  was talking about, both of you will be given feedback: the
	  Director will see where the object was moved, and the
	  Matcher will learn whether they made the correct move or
	  not. If it is incorrect, the object will go back to its
	  original position, and you will try again. If it is
	  correct, you will both automatically advance to the next
	  instruction. There are 8 different grids with different
	  items in different locations, and four instructions per
	  grid. After the final round you will answer a few more
	  questions and be on your way.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Hidden objects </h3>

	<p>
	  What makes this game more interesting is that on some rounds, 
	  <b>curtains</b> will appear in some cells. These curtains
	  block the view of the Director, who cannot know what object,
	  if any, is behind the curtain. To illustrate, here is the
	  Director's view and Matcher's view of the same grid, side by
	  side. The Matcher can see there there is a tennis ball on
	  their side of the curtain, but the Director does not know it
	  is there.
	
	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/director_view.jpg"
		 alt="director view"
		 style="width:300px;height:320px"> 
	    <img src="images/matcher_view.jpg"
		 alt="matcher view"
		 style="width:300px;height:320px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  A few final notes: First, since you are playing with
	  another player, you may see this screen before the game
	  begins:
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/waitScreen.png" alt="wait screen"
		 style="width:700px;height:150px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Just hold tight. Another player should join the game within
	  the next few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes
	  without another player joining, please return the HIT and try again later!
	</p>

	<p>
	  Second, please be respectful of the worker you're playing
	  with: pay close attention and try to be as responsive as
	  possible. During each round, please talk only about the
	  game and please use <b>properties of the object</b>
	  instead of describing locations in the grid. We will be
	  recording the messages you send for research
	  purposes.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once
	  you start the game (including the waiting page). If you
	  refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in
	  and you may not be able to submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
	</p>
