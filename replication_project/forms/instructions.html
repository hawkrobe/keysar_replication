        <h1>Instructions</h1>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Please return this HIT if you have already
      played this game.  Your HIT will not be approved if you have
      played before, and you will be compromising the integrity of the
      results we are obtaining from other participants.</strong></p>

      <p>After finishing the instructions, you will enter a waiting
      room for a game.  Some games require multiple participants, so
      you may have to wait for other players to join before the game
      will start. You will receive a bonus at a constant rate of 12
      cents per minute in the waiting room as long as you stay
      active. <strong>The maximum time you will spend in the waiting
      room is five minutes.</strong> </p>

      <p>Once the game starts, you will see a screen that looks much
      like the following:</p>

      <p>
      <center><img src="gameplay.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:304px;height:260px"></center>
	  </p>

      <p>
	You will be in control of the blue triangle.  When you are not
	holding down any keys, you will move at a slow speed.
	<strong>Holding down space bar will increase your speed.  The
	left and right arrow keys will control the direction of your
	movement.</strong>
      </p>
      </p>
	You will have a score at each point in the game, indicated by
	the percentage shown at the top of the page.  Each location in
	the game area is associated with a certain score.
	<strong>Your goal is to locate yourself in high scoring
	locations for as long as possible.</strong> <strong>You will
	receive a cash bonus based on your cumulative score in the
	game.</strong> The scores of locations will change over time,
	so you will have to continuously be ready to move around to
	maximize your bonus.
      </p>
      
	<p>
	  You will also be able to see the other participants who are
	  currently playing in your game.  These players can also see
	  you.  <strong>The score at any particular location at any
	  particular point in time is the same for all players, and
	  there is no competition between players.</strong>
	</p>

      <p><strong>After the game ends, you will receive a survey code
      to submit with your HIT.  You must submit the code exactly as
      shown to receive your bonus.</strong></p> 
      
      <p><strong>IMPORTANT: If you exit the game window or are
      otherwise detected as inactive in the waiting room or in the
      game, you will be removed from the game and your HIT may not be
      approved.  In order to remain active, you must stay off the
      walls in the game.</strong> When you are touching a wall, your
      score will become a red "0%".</p>

      <p>Players occasionally face bugs during gameplay.  In the rare
      case that you think you are experiencing unexpected game
      behavior and you are not removed from the game automatically
      after a short time, please make a note of your current URL, take
	a screenshot, and message me.</p>
