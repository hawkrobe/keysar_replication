	<p> In this experiment, we'll be playing a communication
	game. The game has two roles, which will be assigned
	randomly. Since you will not know which role you will play
	until the game starts, you will be responsible for
	understanding the responsibilities and goals of both
	roles. 

	If you are the first person to arrive in a game, you must wait
	shortly for another player to join. Once both players have
	joined the game, you will see a display like the
	following: </p>

	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/overall_view.jpg" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:600px;height:320px"></center>
	</p>

	<p> On the right side of the screen, labeled "Play-space", you
	will see a grid filled with various objects. On the left side
	of the screen, labeled "Chatbox", you will see a chat window
	that you can use to communicate with the other player. </p>

	<p> If you are the "director", the grid will be marked to
	indicate how the objects inside are to be moved.  You'll have
	to give instructions to the other player telling them how to
	move the objects. You are responsible for instructing to move
	the items so that they reach the final positions that are
	shown in the picture. Be sure to give your instructions as
	clearly as you possibly could. Given the below screen, for
	example, you would want to tell the other player to move the
	umbrella to the right. </p>

	<p>
	  <center><img src="../stimuli/director_view.jpg" alt="director view" style="width:300px;height:320px"></center>
	</p>

	<p> If you are the "matcher", your job will be to follow the
	director's instructions as best as you can. You will follow
	these instructions by clicking and dragging items from one
	cell of the grid to another. To understand your behavior, we
	will be recording the location of your mouse within the
	grid. For this reason, we will ask you to click on a circle in
	the center of the grid between instructions or if you make an
	incorrect move. This screen will look like the following: </p>

	<p>
	  <center><img src="../stimuli/director_view.jpg" alt="director view" style="width:300px;height:320px"></center>
	</p>	

 We will also be recording the messages both of
	you send.</p>

	<p> An important point for both players to keep in mind is
	that <strong> some cells are occluded </strong>. When the
	background of a cell is white, <strong> the director will not
	know what is behind it </strong>. If you are the matcher, you
	must pay close attention to the fact that the director will
	not be able to see the items in the occluded slots. </p>

	<p> Before we start, there are 3 more things we'd like you to
	keep in mind. </p>
	  
	<ol>
	  <li> During each round, please talk only about the game. Try
	    not to talk about the objects except as needed to move
	    them around the grid. </li>
	  <li> About half of the director's instructions will be
	  scripted. They will appear in the chat box and must be
	  sent unaltered. </li>
	  <li> If you are the matcher, you will click to put a
	    certain object from each grid into a brown bag, and then,
	    with the item still in the bag, put it back in the slot
	    where it belongs. </li>
	</ol>

	There will be 8 different grids with different items.

	The director's goal in this game is to
