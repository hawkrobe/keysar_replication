[x] separate out agent/director roles
	[x] give director the instruction prompt
	    [x] hardcode instruction set in file (about 4 per grid)

[x] make interface for 'scripted' instructions
	[x] hardcode which ones are scripted in object file
	[x] stick the message in the text box -- prevent them from modifying it???
[x] draw things

    [] write exit survey
    [x] write qualification quiz
     	[] fix comprehension check to catch 'empty' responses and allow retry
    [] fix instruction image to reflect real game!
[x] write data to file
	[x] time stamped messages to one file 
	[x] mouse positions to another file
	[x] record errors (send message to server)
	[x] write object to file w/ error (w/ round & fix data)
	[] write object set ID and instruction ID to mouse position file w/ mouse (once Keysar replies)
