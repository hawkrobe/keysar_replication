I would like to have a chance to be on the other side.\n\nI did read the instructions carefully and looked back at them when I was answering the questions. However, part of the way through the experiment, I started to doubt whether I was following them correctly.\n\nI remember that it said not to reference items by where they were on the board, and instead to describe them. I did that, but I couldn't remember if directions like Up and Down were allowed or even if they were mentioned.",
