Also, there were objects similar to the description that I received like \"glass\" or \"candle\" which I made a mistake with as well. Overall, it was a neat communication game. I enjoyed it. Thank you! :)",
            "strategy": "It was my job to listen to instructions. I forgot twice that the director couldn't see what was behind the curtain. I knew that intellectually but I caught myself clicking on item behind a curtain once or twice without thinking. Overall, I needed to pay attention to the details of each object to make sure to move the right one to the proper new spot."
