One way for me this would be easier to understand is perhaps if there was a table or chart that had all the roles of the Listener on one side and all the parts of the speaker in the respective order on the other side =|= \n It would look like this:\n          Speaker         |         Listener\ndescribe object       | identify object\ncan use chat box     | can use chat box\ncannot see curtain  |  can see curtain\n\nBut maybe I am the only one with this confusion.",
